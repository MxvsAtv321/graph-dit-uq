Graph DiT-UQ Project Sanity Report
==================================
Generated: 2025-08-03
Repository: v0.4.0-md-validation (to be created)
Status: PRE-PUBLICATION REVIEW

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
=================
The Graph DiT-UQ project demonstrates a functional physics-ML integration pipeline
with successful Stage 4 MD validation. However, significant repository hygiene and
code quality issues must be addressed before publication. Overall risk level: MEDIUM.

CRITICAL RISKS (Must Fix Before Publication)
============================================

1. LARGE FILES IN GIT HISTORY (Severity: CRITICAL, Owner: DevOps)
   - Files >10MB: checkpoints/graph_dit_10k.pt (76MB), logs/dag_processor_manager/dag_processor_manager.log (6MB)
   - Impact: Repository cloning will fail on slow connections, violates Git best practices
   - Fix: Move to S3 with Git LFS pointers or remove from history entirely
   - Command: git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -f checkpoints/graph_dit_10k.pt' HEAD

2. MISSING .dockerignore (Severity: CRITICAL, Owner: DevOps)
   - Impact: Docker builds include unnecessary files, increased image size, potential secrets exposure
   - Fix: Create .dockerignore with patterns: __pycache__/, *.pyc, .env, logs/, venv/, *.pt
   - Risk: Build artifacts and logs could contain sensitive information

3. CODE QUALITY ISSUES (Severity: HIGH, Owner: ML)
   - 279 ruff violations across codebase
   - Black formatting inconsistencies in multiple files
   - Impact: Code review difficulty, inconsistent style, potential merge conflicts
   - Fix: ruff check --fix . && black -l 88 .
   - Risk: Code maintainability and potential runtime issues

HIGH RISKS (Should Fix Before Publication)
==========================================

4. AIRFLOW LOG FILES IN GIT (Severity: HIGH, Owner: DevOps)
   - Found: 6MB+ of Airflow log files tracked in Git
   - Impact: Repository bloat, potential sensitive information in logs
   - Fix: Add logs/ to .gitignore and remove from tracking
   - Risk: Logs may contain sensitive information or large file sizes

5. INCOMPLETE .gitignore (Severity: HIGH, Owner: DevOps)
   - Missing: *.pt, .pytest_cache, *.DS_Store, logs/, venv/, __pycache__/
   - Impact: Accidental commits of large files, build artifacts, system files
   - Fix: Add missing patterns to .gitignore
   - Risk: Repository bloat and potential secrets exposure

6. CI/CD IMAGE PINNING (Severity: MEDIUM, Owner: DevOps)
   - Current: Uses @v3, @v4 tags instead of digests
   - Impact: Potential supply chain attacks, non-reproducible builds
   - Fix: Pin to specific SHA256 digests
   - Risk: Security vulnerabilities from compromised base images

MEDIUM RISKS (Should Address)
=============================

7. MISSING TYPE HINTS (Severity: MEDIUM, Owner: ML)
   - Impact: Reduced code maintainability, potential runtime errors
   - Fix: Add mypy type hints to all public APIs
   - Risk: Type-related bugs in production

8. MISSING ENVIRONMENT LOCK (Severity: MEDIUM, Owner: ML)
   - Impact: Non-reproducible environments, dependency conflicts
   - Fix: Create requirements-lock.txt
   - Risk: Different results on different machines

9. LARGE SCREENSHOT FILES (Severity: LOW, Owner: Docs)
    - Found: screenshots/early_pareto.png (664K), screenshots/uncertainty_pareto.png (792K)
    - Impact: Repository bloat, slow cloning
    - Fix: Move to S3 or optimize image sizes
    - Risk: Repository size growth

10. MISSING MANUSCRIPT STRUCTURE (Severity: LOW, Owner: Docs)
    - Impact: No proper LaTeX manuscript for publication
    - Fix: Create paper/main.tex and supporting files
    - Risk: Publication delays

LOW RISKS (Nice to Have)
========================

11. MISSING SECURITY.md (Severity: LOW, Owner: DevOps)
    - Impact: No clear security disclosure process
    - Fix: Create SECURITY.md with disclosure policy
    - Risk: Security issues not reported properly

12. MISSING API DOCUMENTATION (Severity: LOW, Owner: ML)
    - Impact: Difficult for others to use the codebase
    - Fix: Add comprehensive docstrings and type hints
    - Risk: Reduced adoption and community contribution

13. TEST WARNINGS (Severity: LOW, Owner: ML)
    - Found: 10 warnings in test suite (torch size mismatches, AHI reward issues)
    - Impact: Potential runtime issues, unclear test behavior
    - Fix: Address tensor size mismatches and reward computation issues
    - Risk: Silent failures in production

SUBSYSTEM-SPECIFIC RISKS
========================

Docker & Containerization:
- Missing .dockerignore (CRITICAL)
- No non-root UID drop in Dockerfiles (MEDIUM)
- No container vulnerability scanning (MEDIUM)

Airflow & Pipeline:
- Log files in Git (HIGH)
- Missing error handling in some DAGs (MEDIUM)
- No resource limits specified (LOW)

Data & Artifacts:
- Large files in Git history (CRITICAL)
- No data versioning strategy (MEDIUM)
- Missing data validation (MEDIUM)

Testing & CI:
- 35/36 tests passing (97% pass rate) ✅
- Missing integration tests for full pipeline (MEDIUM)
- No performance benchmarks (LOW)

Security:
- No secrets scanning (MEDIUM)
- No dependency vulnerability scanning (MEDIUM)
- Missing security disclosure policy (LOW)

RECOMMENDED FIX SEQUENCE
========================

Phase 1 (Critical - Must Fix):
1. Create .dockerignore
2. Move large files to S3
3. Fix .gitignore
4. Remove log files from Git

Phase 2 (High Priority):
1. Apply Black formatting
2. Fix ruff violations
3. Pin CI images to digests
4. Create environment lock file

Phase 3 (Medium Priority):

3. Add API documentation
4. Set up container scanning

Phase 4 (Low Priority):

3. Add performance monitoring
4. Create release notes

ESTIMATED EFFORT
================
- Critical fixes: 2-4 hours
- High priority fixes: 4-6 hours

| Stage | Success Criteria | Current Status | Blocking Issues | Owner |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|-------|
| Stage 1 | Data preprocessing | ✅ Working | None | ML |
| Stage 2 | Model training | ✅ Working | None | ML |
| Stage 3 | RL optimization | ✅ Working | None | ML |
| Stage 4 | MD validation | ✅ Working | None | ML |

CONCLUSION
==========
The Graph DiT-UQ project has a solid technical foundation with successful
physics-ML integration demonstrated through Stage 4 MD validation. However,
significant repository hygiene and code quality issues must be addressed
before publication. The critical and high-priority fixes can be completed
within 1-2 days, making the project ready for publication review.
